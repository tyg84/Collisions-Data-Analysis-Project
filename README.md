I consider this project to be complete for now. Perhaps in the future I will update this webpage not as an Open Data Award submission.
Update as of 12/25: I finished the code for sort by ward (testmap3.html). This is not required to run my main submission.
Update as of 12/31: I finished my submission code. testmap4 (Submission).html is the main webpage and collisions_with_wards.csv is required to run it. 
collisions_with_wards.csv is generated with Collisions_Project (2).ipynb. The Collisions_Project (2).ipynb is where I take from Toronto's open data; specifically, the police report of collisions dataset and the ward boundaries dataset.
